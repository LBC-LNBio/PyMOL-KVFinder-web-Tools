abstract = {Biological processes are regulated mainly by the binding of small molecules into cavities distributed throughout the biomolecular structure. Computational tools to detect these cavities have an essential role in rational drug design. With the exponential availability of high-order 3D atomic structures and large sets of atomic models, the tools must balance accuracy and speed. In this sense, we developed parKVFinder, a parallelized software for geometry-based cavity detection. Here, we described its functionalities and presented its easy-to-use PyMOL plugin and command-line interface. Finally, we demonstrated parKVFinder by identifying an important HIV-1 protease cavity and compared it with other geometry-based programs.}

abstract = {Abstract Detecting and analysing protein cavities provides significant information about active sites for biological processes (e.g. protein–protein or protein–ligand binding) in molecular graphics and modelling. Using the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a given protein (i.e. atom types and their locations in 3D) as retrieved from a PDB (Protein Data Bank) file, it is now computationally viable to determine a description of these cavities. Such cavities correspond to pockets, clefts, invaginations, voids, tunnels, channels and grooves on the surface of a given protein. In this work, we survey the literature on protein cavity computation and classify algorithmic approaches into three categories: evolution-based, energy-based and geometry-based. Our survey focuses on geometric algorithms, whose taxonomy is extended to include not only sphere-, grid- and tessellation-based methods, but also surface-based, hybrid geometric, consensus and time-varying methods. Finally, we detail those techniques that have been customized for GPU (graphics processing unit) computing.},
